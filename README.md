## Current Projects

### 1. DC Motor Speed Control with PID

A simple and clear demonstration of **PID control** for a DC motor.

**Features:**

- Models a DC motor in MATLAB
- PID controller for speed regulation
- Step response simulation
- Plots motor speed and control input

### 2. Advanced MPC for Autonomous Vehicle Path Tracking
A Linear Time-Varying Model Predictive Controller (LTV-MPC) simulates an autonomous vehicle following a curved reference trajectory.
***Features:***
Kinematic bicycle model ([X; Y; Î¸] states)
Linearized time-varying MPC
Quadratic programming (QP) optimization (quadprog)
Steering constraints enforced
Logs vehicle states, steering commands, cross-track and heading errors
Dashboard plots:
Vehicle path vs reference
steering input
Cross-track error
Heading error
Requirements: MATLAB + Optimization Toolbox
